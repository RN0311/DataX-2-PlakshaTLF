# DataX-2-PlakshaTLF Project

## Speech To Text Summarization
As a core task of natural language processing and information retrieval, automatic text summarization is widely used in many places. This paper describes a novel hybrid summarization model, which generates text from audio input using two independent components : an automatic speech recognizer and a summarizer. To verify the performance of our model, we compared it with the current popular automatic text summary model on CNN/Daily Mail dataset, and then used ROUGE(Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) as well as BLEU score metrics as our evaluation method.
